# DBS-EvaDB-Proj1

Aim of this project is to employ Tiny-Llama LLM in order to execute a particularly interesting NLP task â€“ namely text generation. Moreover, Eva-DB platform is being employed, which makes loading of CSV files, and launching new custom functions for such tasks relatively easier. Here, you just can call a custom function with a few lines, and handle it all like you would do with a SQL table.
Hence, all the abilities of a particular database management system are offered to you, through python framework and makes particularly easy to employ common AI function and tasks just with a few lines, through Eva-DB platform.
