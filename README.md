# DBS-EvaDB-Proj1

* **Project Aim**: Employ Tiny-Llama Learning Model for a particularly interesting NLP  (Natural Language Processing) task - i.e. text generation.
* **Utilizing Eva-DB**: The project uses the Eva-DB platform for easier loading of CSV files and running custom functions.
* With Eva-DB, you can define and call custom functions with just a few lines of code, and working with data is quite similar to working with a SQL table. Eva-DB provides access to database management system capabilities through a Python framework, allowing you to execute AI function in that particular style.
* **Easy AI Integration**: The platform simplifies the use of common AI functions and tasks with minimal code.
* Moreover, this project aims to use Sentiment Analysis as a tool to verify how proper are the sentences generated by Tiny-llama. 
* Dataset with unfinished sentences are considered as input, and corresponding outputs are provided too. Later, we check the labels (through sentiment analysis) whether they match with the generated text's labels or not.
